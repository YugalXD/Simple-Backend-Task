Goal
====
Produce a simple REST API to track the expenses.

Mandatory Work
--------------

1. Saves expenses as entered into a database.
2. Retrieves them for display on the page. 
3. Add new columns to the table displaying the GST amount for each expense including the state and center GST.
4. Alter the README to contain instructions on how to build and run your app.
5. Share the postman collection.

Goods and Services Tax is an indirect tax used in India. It has multiple rate slabs depending on the expense type, 5%,12%,28% of the value of the expense, and is included in the amount entered by the user.

Give our account `yugalxd` access to your fork, and send us an email when you’re done. Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear, confusing, or just plain missing.

Extra Credit
------------
These are optional but are a chance to show off useful skills you might have. If it's outside your experience, no stress.

1. Provide a deployment mechanism/package for your app so we don't have to build it to run it. Docker, vagrant, or something else entirely?
2. Implementing the full GST rate slab. https://www.paisabazaar.com/tax/gst-rates/
